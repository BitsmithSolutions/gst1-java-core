gstreamer1.x-java
=================

This is a version of gstreamer-java mostly compatible with gstreamer 1.0/1.2 including some changes donated by CafeX Communications.

Originally this code was taken from https://code.google.com/p/gstreamer-java/.

Current Status
==============
This code is generally working well for creating elements and simple pipelines.  However certain parts of the code base haven't been fully ported so certain capabilities do not yet work.  There is no official list of what is working or not and please do not get upset if you application crashes.
